# Description

## Pathological states recognition technology based on physiological signal, ECG.
* Pathological states
  1) Congestive heart failure (CHF) patients
  2) Healthy young group
  3) Healthy elderly group

* Public ECG datasets are accessable from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)

* Extracted features: complexity of time series using Multiscale Entropy methods
